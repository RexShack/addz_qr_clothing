# addz_qr_clothing
To toggle some clothes on/off for REDM QRCORE Framework

Here are some available Command available

- /hat = toggle hat on/off
- /shirt = toggle shirt on/off
- /pants = toggle pants on/off
- /boots = toggle boots on/off
- /coats = toggle coats on/off
- /glove = toggle glove on/off
- /closedcoats = toggle closedcoats on/off
- /ponchos = toggle ponchos on/off
- /sleeve = toggle sleeve on/off

NOTE :

1. For pants, I need to remove boots as well so that the skin appear.
2. You need qr-clothes since this resource is dependent on qr-clothes
3. If you use radial menu, i already prepared the config in optional folder. You need to copy and paste into your radial menu config.

Thanks to :

2. QRCORE Team.
